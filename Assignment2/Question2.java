/* Line 10 refers is really important 
it refers consists of two parts 
First part,"h.getOrDefault(arr[i],0)+1" 
in the hashmap we are using the "value" to count the number of 
occurence of arr[i] in the array
Second part, h.put(arr[i],....) this adds a new element with
the same key arr[i] but a different value that is the updated 
number of occurences of the element arr[i] */
